# Getting Started
Om Zone is all about zen and relaxation. It allows users to get into a good rhythm of Meditatiing each day and seeing their progress with the tracker. Users can set different backgrounds which have a song track to help users relax or opt to do a silent breathing meditation. The profile page will display the last 7 times the user has meditating, showing the date and for how long the meditated for along with 2 different stats section to track their progress.
